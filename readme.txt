2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
I invested around 1 hour reviewing JS (and I noticed it isn't too different from other prog langs in terms of syntax). 
Mondays and Wednesdays, I worked on this assignment roughly at least 2 hours (~ 8 hours distributed). Tuesdays and 
Thursdays, I worked on this assignment for most of the day (so maybe ~ 24 hours distributed). This is not an exaggeration but 
an honest and rough estimate.

Total in hours: at least 32 hours


3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list sites like StackOverflow or specific URLs for tutorials, etc.)
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript
    * Used this website to review JS since it felt that we were going too fast in class (well at least for me).


4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I consulted with Vanessa Lebel. We discussed things like: needing counter variables (that keep track of each tweet category) and
using the forEach method so each counter can increment according to the amount of categorical tweet, how to update class tags (syntax), 



5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
No.
