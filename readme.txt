2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
I invested around 1 hour to review JS (and I noticed it isn't too different from other prog langs in terms of syntax). As I
type this sentence, it is 1/26 and I hope it isn't too hard to implement my limited JS knowledge :)
I invested an average of at least 3 hours per day (for 7 days).

Total in hours: ~ 21 hours


3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list sites like StackOverflow or specific URLs for tutorials, etc.)
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript
    * Used this website to review JS since it felt that we were going too fast in class (well at least for me).


4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I consulted with Vanessa Lebel. We discussed things like: needing counter variables (that keep track of each tweet category) and
using the forEach method so each counter can increment according to the amount of categorical tweet, how to update class tags (syntax), 



5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
No.
